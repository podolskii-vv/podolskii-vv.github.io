    <h4>Overview</h4>
        <p>Reviews a number of important algorithms, with emphasis on correctness and efficiency. The topics covered include solution of recurrence equations, sorting algorithms, binary search trees, partitioning, graphs, spanning trees, shortest paths, connectivity, depth-first and breadth-first search, dynamic programming, and divide-and-conquer techniques. We will try to cover most of chapters 1-4, 6-8, 12, 15, 16, 22-25, 30, 31, 34 of [CLRS] (see the link in Resourses below).</p>

        <h3>Course Policies</h3>

        <article id="homework">
          <h4>Homework</h4>
          <p>Homework should be submitted in PDF form in Gradescope. We prefer homework submissions typeset in LaTex. If you are not familiar with LaTex, it is a great skill to learn. <a href="https://www.overleaf.com">Overleaf</a> provides a simple web interface for writing and compiling LaTex (as well as extensive documentation). We will provide with <a href="https://www.overleaf.com/read/ghmyhfywqwdq">Overleaf templates</a> that you can use for your homework. You are encouraged to insert scanned figures or illustrations where appropriate. Scanned handwritten submissions will only be graded if perfectly legible. If you are unsure about your handwriting, we strongly suggest you type your solutions. Honors questions will be graded, but will not affect your grade in any way.</p>
        </article>

        <article id="collab">
          <h4>Collaboration</h4>
          <p>We strongly encourage you to discuss assignments with your peers, but you must (a) list the names of your discussion partners on your submission, and (b) you must write up your solution on your own. You may not look at the written solutions of any other student before submitting your own solution. Failing to list the names of your collaborators, will result in penalties.</p>
        </article>

        <article id="late-policy">
          <h4>Late Policy</h4>
          <p>Late submissions will not be graded. No exceptions. Instead, the lowest 2 HW scores will be dropped.
